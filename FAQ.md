## Scroll wheel doesn't work correctly!

As is described in [#203][tmodloader-issue-203], it's a vanilla bug. If you're using `Subtle frameskip`, you may face this problem.

As I've tested, turning **`on`** frameskip can solve this problem. Discussion in the issue mentioned that turning _`off`_ may also work, but on my machine it still have problems.

(`subtle` scrolls hundreds of times, `off` scrools 2 to 3 times, and `on` scrolls once, which works correctly.)
